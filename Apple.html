<p = id="reports">

Apple has significant decreases in revenue growth rate, continuing a downward trend starting in 2011. Its current P/E ratio of 15.86 is low over its ten-year range. <br>
<p id = "keyfigures">Key Figures:</p>
<p = id="reports">
Sales growth averaged 45% has dropped to 8% in the past two years. <br><br>
Apple products use components which include resources and uniquely manufactured products that trade like commodities, and its suppliers experience industry wide shortages of their products that cause significant price fluctuations in Apples operating costs. 
<br> <br>
Retained asset growth has slowed to 12% since its peak at 58.28% 2010 despite capital expenditure growth continuing to increase annually. <br><br>

Apple has a launched new products like the iWatch since the drops in these growth areas, but it has not had impact of the iPod, iPhone and iPad on sales. Apple's two quarterly reports mentions high EPS growth on the strength of its established products.<br><br>

Apple's software sales and peripheral sales continue increasing, and its line of PC sales are experiencing growth as well. 

<br>
<p id = "keyfigures">Additional Factors:</p>
<p = id="reports">
Increasing globalization has decreased supplier costs for Apple, allowing for multiple suppliers of some components. Management actively manages interest rate and F/X risk, but supplier shortages are and challenging to hedge.<br><br> 

Apple conducts a large amount of manufaturing in areas that are prone to geopolitical risk, causing a diversifiable risk in delays of its product launches and inventory deliveries. </p>
