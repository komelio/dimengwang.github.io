Apple maintains solid performance in most indicators, but the question is how much of the performance in the past few years is the tailwind of Steve Jobs legacy. Significant decreases in revenue growth rate points to a worrying trend for a company that has been built on innovation and technological progress. A recent share buyback has led to a low EPS for the company, and we will see short term gains.<br><br>
Fundamentals:<br><br>
Tech companies are volatile firms which are difficult to project. Further, the large cash holdings of the largest tech firms can help mask problems or flaws in business operations. However, two trends emerge from an analysis of Apple’s business operations. Sales growth, which averaged 45% for 8 years of the last decade, has dropped to 8% in the past two years. <br><br>
The firm still maintains a high ROE of 35%, but the growth in ROE has essentially leveled out since 2005. Earnings remain high, but so are the firm’s costs, as its highly engineered products often require specialized parts built for the company, as well as normal parts which are highly sought after.<br> <br>
Retained asset growth has slowed significantly since Steve Job’s passing, following a similar trend to sales growth. This is unlikely to be a critical indicator, as the company’s primary physical assets are in retail properties. However the firm is still increasing its capital expenditures, so the slowdown in asset growth signifies more losses on investments.  <br><br>
The firm has a launched new products like the iWatch since the drops in these key growth areas, but the impact of the iWatch on earnings still needs to be determined months of after the launch. Certainly it has not had the impact of previous launches such as the iPod, iPhone and iPad. Apple's two quarterly reports mentions high EPS growth on the strength of its established products.<br><br>
Overall, the firm’s core businesses remain intact. The firm’s software’s and peripherals continue gaining sales, and its line of PCs are experiencing growth. However, the long-term prospects of the firm are not as bright as it was under the direction of Jobs, and the spectacular growth of the firm has peaked. Until Tim Cook can become an aggressive manager, Apple will no longer be a growth company.<br><br>
Additional Factors:<br><br>
Increasing globalization plays well for Apple, as it has many options to source parts, one of the largest risk factors for the firm. The firm actively manages interest rate and F/X risk, and so these indicators do not play a large role in firm operations.<br><br> 
Tensions in Asian politics, particularly between China and the South East Asian nations may cause trouble for Apple’s manufacturing process & future hardware launches.</p>
